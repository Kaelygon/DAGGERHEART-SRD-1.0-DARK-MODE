### Modifications:  
- Converted to HTML using [webtopdf](https://webtopdf.com/)  
- The script "injectHTML.sh" links css/dark_mode.css to DH-SRD.html  
  - Set background color to Dark Gray Muted Blue  
  - Set font color to Light gray  
  - Mixed SVG image colors in CSS 
  - Shifted container to middle of the screen  
  
### Why?  
Because my weak eyes get tired staring at the original SRD PDF at 4am when I'm trying to get my sheet together  
I like blue and viewing stuff in browser  
  
### How?

**Don't bother the Daggerheart team**, if you have issues with this HTML implementation. Create an issue and I'll see if I can do something about it.  
My goal is to keep the text original with only visual changes, but the conversion may not be perfect.  
  
### Known issues:  
- No jump links in CONTENTS: webtopdf.com issue  
- Attempting to copy a text column includes the next column: webtopdf.com issue
