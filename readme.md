### Modifications:  
- Converted to HTML using [webtopdf](https://webtopdf.com/)  
- The script "injectHTMLDiv.sh" adds .container_center_page and links css/dark_mode.css to DH-SRD.html  
  - Set background color to \#282830 (Muted Dark Blue)  
  - Set font color to \#d4d4d4 (Light gray)  
  - Set SVG images to multiplicative (Blend with blue background)  
  - Shifted container to middle of the screen  
  
### Why?  
Because my weak eyes get tired staring at the original SRD PDF at 4am when I'm trying to get my sheet together  
I like blue and viewing stuff in browser
