Darrington Press Community Gaming License
This Community Gaming License (“License”) describes how you (“you”) can use certain content owned by
Darrington Press, LLC (“DRP”) in your own creations. By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below),
you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License. You should read and
understand the terms of this License before adapting or sharing any content belonging to DRP. In this
License, you and DRP may be referred to together as the “parties” and individually as a “party.”

1.​ Definitions.
1.1.​“DRP Games” means the role-playing game(s) offered by DRP titled Candela Obscura and
Daggerheart.

1.2.​“Licensed Rights” means the rights that you are being permitted to use by agreeing to the terms
and conditions of this License.

1.3.​“Licensed Content” means: (a) game rules (but not a copy/paste of rulebook content),
mechanics, systems, toolsets, reference cards, and stat blocks; and (b) the names and attributes
of game characters, settings, locations, monsters, classes, subclasses, and races featured in
DRP Games. This term excludes all Prohibited Content. Note that this does not include
campaign frames in Daggerheart unless explicitly stated.

1.4.​“DRP Published Content” means content released by DRP or its related companies, Critical Role
Productions, LLC and Gilmore’s Glorious Goods, LLC (together, “Related Companies”) in any
published works (print and digital) including without limitation in promotional material or in video,
audio, or audiovisual media (for example, podcasts, streams on streaming sites such as Twitch,
YouTube videos, and television episodes).

1.5.​“Prohibited Content” means all of the following published or used in connection with the DRP
Game or by DRP or its Related Companies generally, unless such content is expressly
addressed elsewhere in this License: (a) trademarks, logos, trade dress, trade names, and
service marks; (b) videos, trailers, audio sounds, music, video games, comic books, novels,
artwork, visual images, illustrations, drawings, graphics, imagery, plots, storylines, published
work titles, and maps; (c) the exact text of manuals, guides, handbooks, campaign frames and
rulebooks; and (d) DRP Published Content, unless such content is explicitly identified in writing
by DRP as being Public Game Content.

1.6.​“Public Game Content” means Licensed Content and any additional content that is explicitly and
clearly identified in writing by DRP as Public Game Content, but specifically excludes all
Prohibited Content. Currently, in addition to Licensed Content, DRP offers the following as Public
Game Content: Daggerheart System Reference Document 1.0 and Candela Obscura.

1.7.​“Adaptive Content” means content that is derived from or is based on Public Game Content or in
which the Public Game Content is translated, altered, rearranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified.

1.8.​“Share” means to provide content to the public by any means or process including without
limitation by way of reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
or communication, as well as making content available to the public by any means or process.
The word “public” includes, without limitation, any person or entity other than you. For example,
“public” would cover other participants in your personal gaming group or members of a DRP
1

subreddit.

1.9.​“Permitted Formats” means: (a) physical print and digital print formats in the form of
supplements, manuals, books, stories, novels, and cards; (b) live-streaming and video on sites
such as Twitch.tv, YouTube, and TikTok; and (c) podcasts. This term excludes, without limitation,
film, television, video games, and any other audiovisual medium not expressly permitted.
From time to time we will make available DRP Games that we are still testing and developing
(collectively “Playtest Materials”). This includes materials found in our playtest program known as
The Void, found at www.daggerheart.com/thevoid. Materials for Playtesting are described as
alpha, beta, demo, demonstration, evaluation, trial, early access, or preview (or some other words
which impart a similar meaning). For Playtest Materials, no commercial products are permitted in
any format, regardless of whether it is a Permitted Format identified above or some other format.
For example, you can live-stream gameplay from Playtest Materials for free, but you cannot sell
written content such as supplements or novels adapted from Playtest Materials.

5.​ Release of Infringement Claims. DRP does not intend to copy or infringe upon any Adaptive Content
created by you. However, because of the possibility that DRP may independently develop or publish
materials that are similar to Adaptive Content created by third parties, in exchange for allowing you to
exercise the Licensed Rights within this document, you hereby waive and release any and all claims,
demands, or causes of action that you may now have or may in the future have against DRP for
infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of rights in or to any Adaptive Content, except to the
extent that DRP has copied such Adaptive Content in its entirety and without modification.

5.1.​You agree that DRP has the right to develop, acquire, license, sell, exploit, and Share materials,
products, and content that are substantially similar to or otherwise compete with your Adaptive
Content; provided, however, that DRP agrees it will not identically copy your Adaptive Content.

release and discharge DRP and its owners, officers, directors, employees, assigns, agents,
affiliates and representatives from any and all known and unknown claims including all future
claims that you may or may not be aware of at the time that you create your Adaptive Content
that DRP has infringed or is infringing any rights you may hold in any Adaptive Content, except

release in this paragraph includes claims that may arise in the future due to the later actions of a
party or parties.

any jurisdiction or forum against DRP asserting a claim released by this License.

harmless from and against any and all costs and expenses arising therefrom (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, whether or not litigation is actually commenced).

5.5.​You specifically understand, acknowledge, and agree that this is a full and final release which
applies to any and all of the claims released herein whether known or unknown and whether
past, present, or future. You hereby expressly waive any right or benefit of the provisions of

law or statute elsewhere in the world, as well as waiving all federal, state, and common-law
statutes or principles of similar effect:

THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO
EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND

CONTENT, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES
WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER

9.​ Term and Termination.
9.1.​This License applies for the term of the copyrights in Public Game Content used or Shared by
you. However, if you fail to comply with this License or do not accept any amended License
terms, then, except as limited in Section 11.3 below, your rights under this License terminate
automatically and without notice.

9.2.​You may terminate this License for any reason by ceasing all use and Sharing of Public Game
Content and Adaptive Content.

9.3.​DRP may stop distributing the Public Game Content at any time; however, doing so will not
automatically terminate this License.

and Sharing any Public Game Content and Adaptive Content.

9.5.​Sections 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 survive termination of this License.
10.​Limitation Period on Claims. All claims arising from or relating to this License must be brought no later
than one year after such claim arose or the party having such claim shall be deemed to have waived
and forever released it. A claim based on a claim by a third party shall be deemed to have arisen at
the time that the party asserting the claim first became aware of it.

11.​Amendments or Revisions to License.
11.1.​DRP may modify or revise the License at any time in its sole discretion by posting the amended
License on its website located at https://darringtonpress.com/ and announcing the change on
at least one of DRP’s social media channels. The modification or revision will become effective
after such postings. DRP will indicate on the License the date it was last amended. You are
responsible for checking the License regularly for changes, and you waive any right to receive
specific notice of changes.

11.2.​Except as limited by Section 11.3 below, your continued Sharing of Public Game Content or
Adaptive Content after a License modification confirms your acceptance of any changes to the
License, and, except as expressly limited in Section 11.3 below, you will be bound by such
revised terms even if you did not receive specific notice of the changes and even if you failed to
check the License regularly for changes. If you do not accept such changes, the License will
terminate as described in Section 9.1.

11.3.​If you are distributing Adaptive Content or have taken substantial steps in the production of
Adaptive Content at the time DRP issues a License amendment, you will be permitted to
continue distributing that exact Adaptive Content (“Existing Adaptive Content”) under the terms
of the License that was in place prior to the amendment even if you do not agree to the License
as amended. The prior License version will continue to cover such Existing Adaptive Content.
However, you agree that any modified version of such Existing Adaptive Content or derivative
6

work thereof or new creation of Adaptive Content (collectively “New Adaptive Content”) will be
subject to the amended License, and your use of any New Adaptive Content after the effective
date of any amended License shall automatically be deemed to be an agreement by you to the
terms and conditions of the amended License with respect to any exploitation by you of the
New Adaptive Content.

12.​Other Terms and Conditions.
12.1.​DRP will not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by you
unless expressly agreed in a writing that is signed by DRP.

12.2.​This License sets forth the entire current agreement of the parties with respect to its subject
matter, supersedes any previous or contemporaneous oral or written agreements regarding
such subject matter and can only be amended or modified by DRP.

12.3.​To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be
automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the
provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this License without affecting the
enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions of this License.

12.4.​Unless expressly agreed to by DRP, no term or condition of this License will be waived and no
failure by you to comply will be deemed to have been consented to by DRP.

12.5.​You agree that you have carefully reviewed this agreement, that you understand its terms, that,
if desired, you have sought legal advice with respect to this agreement, and that you have
relied wholly on your own judgment and knowledge in entering into this agreement.

12.6.​This License shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
California without regard to principles of conflict of laws that would cause the laws of any other
jurisdiction to apply.
